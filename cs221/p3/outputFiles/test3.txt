at
beginning
this
chapter
we
demonstrated
how
to
for
an
element
we
first
check
whether
item
if
not
we
compare
element
look
either
left
or
right
subtree
this
statement
looks
recursive
lets
apply
general
guidelines
for
determining
recursive
solutions
we
have
choices
for
size
problem
number
or
number
path
from
to
for
which
we
are
searching
or
until
we
reach
an
empty
either
acceptable
first
easier
to
say
second
more
precise
one
base
case
arises
when
we
find
element
same
key
another
occurs
when
we
determine
an
element
same
key
not
general
case
either
to
element
from
left
subtree
or
to
from
right
subtree
because
left
or
right
subtree
at
least
one
smaller
than
original
one
level
deeper
size
decreases
call
only
one
more
question
remains
how
do
we
know
there
no
item
same
key
if
empty
then
cannot
contain
an
item
same
key
as
items
key
lets
summarize
these
we
define
recursive
routine
which
invoked
by
retrieveitem
member
function
